The *codes* folder contains the source code developed to implement the model and conduct the two groups of experiments described in the paper. The code was developed in Google Colab using Python 3.10.12, with Keras and TensorFlow library versions 2.15.0. Therefore, we recommend running the code in Google Colab and saving the results to Google Drive for ease of access.

The *data* folder contains the preprocessed data considered in the paper. Details about the data are provided in the section “2.1. Area of study and datasets” of the paper.

The *docs* folder contains the Readme file with general information on this repository.

The *figs* folder contains PDF files of all the figures presented in the paper.
